#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE orderID <> ''
AND OrderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND orderID <> ''
AND OrderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
FROM customers
JOIN FebSales
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
WHERE orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT product, MIN(price)
FROM JanSales
WHERE product <> ''
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity) * price AS Revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE LOCATION='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
AND orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct customers.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity>2
AND orderid <> ''
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
