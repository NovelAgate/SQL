                    <h1>Get to Know Me :-)</h1><p><b>Name:</b> Lillie (but you can call me Lil). Fun fact: I’ve never really been a big fan of the spelling of my name because, being named after my paternal grandmother, I’ve always considered it the ‘old time’ spelling (it was popular in the late 19th century, dropped off for a while, and is very slowly making a reappearance). It’s taken me most of my life to warm-up to it, but there are still some days I don’t like it very much. I usually prefer to write my name in cursive; I feel it’s prettier that way.</p><p><b>Age:</b> Now, don’t you know it’s rude to ask a woman her age?! LOL! I just turned the big 3-0 at the end of May. I know it’s not considered ‘older’, but I’ve had a lot of experiences in that time that make me feel like a good chunk of my life has passed me by. One of my main goals for this new year, however, is learning to let go of what I’ve lost out on and focusing instead of what I still have to look forward to.</p><p><b>Hobbies:</b> I’m a real homebody, so I love writing; reading (I read a book a week, and I always read more than one); singing; watching movies/TV; can food be a hobby? Not cooking per se, just thinking about food? I admit &hellip; I have a problem &hellip;</p><p><b>Favorite Food:</b> Pizza!!! (Pepsi, of course, has to go with it! Preferably Pizza Hut Pepsi!) Second favorite is anything to do with carbs. Albanese Gummies are a VERY close second, but it all depends on the day.</p><p><b>Occupation:</b> (Does anyone else feel old using that word instead of just saying ‘job’?) Sadly, I’ve been unemployed since September 19, 2019, due to all my health problems – my NMO was only recently diagnosed on December 11, 2023 at 2:30 p.m. (No, I’m not weird for knowing the exact time. When the last few years of your life have been dedicated to finding out what’s been going on, you KNOW the time you finally got answers)</p><p><b>Dream Job:</b> (Now, I can’t say ‘Dream Occupation’ – that just sounds so weird!) Because I’ve been unemployed for so long and have been off that whole schedule, my dream is just to be my own boss. I’ve tried for YEARS to find a job I can do from home (one, because of all my health problems and two, because of my baby girl (my cavapoo, Lucy). We all joke that she has separation anxiety and can’t bear to be away from me, but the same is true for me as well. With everything I have going on, she has been an amazing source of comfort and I’m just not ready to be separated from her yet. I think I would really like to be involved in writing of some type. Writing/journaling has really been therapeutic for me and a way to escape. Someday I hope to write a book or something and share everything I’ve been through.</p><p>If there is anything else you would like to know, please feel free to ask :-)</p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="270" data-orig-width="310"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6a2d0a1eb4257c0a0e1a8a64a93d1b2f/e337a27ee466cf9e-2f/s640x960/cc7c03b507901a1f7b08dfa7a5b621573ce123bb.png" data-orig-height="270" data-orig-width="310" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6a2d0a1eb4257c0a0e1a8a64a93d1b2f/e337a27ee466cf9e-2f/s75x75_c1/34efc87f34aa761c325650e152d05bcd31fa06c0.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/6a2d0a1eb4257c0a0e1a8a64a93d1b2f/e337a27ee466cf9e-2f/s100x200/2c9b449892cd3b2feb1c3f7db860fe738ecd7ee7.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/6a2d0a1eb4257c0a0e1a8a64a93d1b2f/e337a27ee466cf9e-2f/s250x400/db1159648bfe3f8f44a7caf7650bb086c48dca23.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/6a2d0a1eb4257c0a0e1a8a64a93d1b2f/e337a27ee466cf9e-2f/s400x600/72b789b107a67d73c8ea9e7cc0976a9267717936.png 310w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px"/></figure></div>
